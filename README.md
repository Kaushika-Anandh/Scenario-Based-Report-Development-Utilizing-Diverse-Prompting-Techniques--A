    - Provide store-specific information (locations, business hours, promotions).
    - Offer personalized shopping recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.
- **Target Audience:** 
    1.	`Primary Users:` Retail customers, including potential buyers, existing customers, and those tracking orders.
    2.	`Secondary Users: `Retail customer support team members who may handle escalated issues.
- **Objectives:**
    1.	`Customer Engagement:` Create a chatbot that can interact naturally with users, offering a friendly and helpful tone.

    - `Example Prompt:` "What technical infrastructure is required to support a chatbot capable of handling thousands of customer inquiries in real-time?"
    - Technical Findings:
        1.	Data Handling:
            - Real-time data streaming for product updates, order status, and promotions.
            - Cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS or Google Cloud) for scalable and secure data storage.
        2.	Frameworks:
            - GPT-based conversational models for natural language processing.
            - APIs for integration with e-commerce platforms, payment gateways, and customer databases.
        3.	Hardware Requirements:
            - Servers with high processing power to handle multiple customer interactions simultaneously.
            - Multi-channel integration (web, mobile, messaging apps) to expand accessibility.
-  Refinement Prompts
    - `Example Prompt:` "What improvements can be made to ensure the chatbot offers faster response times for order tracking queries?"
    - Improvements:
        1.	Order Status Caching: Preload order status information to provide instant responses for frequent queries.
        2.	Faster Integration: Ensure real-time data retrieval from the order management system.
        3.	Personalization: Offer a one-click option for order tracking using customer authentication.
- Scenario Testing Prompts
    - `Example Prompt:` "Simulate a scenario where a customer uses the chatbot to inquire about a product’s availability and place an order."
    - Outcome:
        1.	Chatbot Flow:
            - The chatbot greets the customer and asks for the product they are interested in.
            - Provides availability information and details about the product.
            - Suggests similar items if the product is out of stock.
            - Facilitates the checkout process and provides a link to the payment gateway.
        2.	Gaps Identified:
            - Users occasionally had difficulty finding similar products.
            - Simplified recommendations were introduced to make similar item suggestions more visible.
